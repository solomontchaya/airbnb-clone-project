# API Security

## Key Security Measures

### 1. Authentication
**Implementation:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with secure token storage and refresh token rotation
**Purpose:** Ensures that only verified users can access protected endpoints by validating user identity through encrypted tokens.

### 2. Authorization
**Implementation:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with permission levels for guests, hosts, and administrators
**Purpose:** Controls what actions users can perform based on their roles, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive operations.

### 3. Rate Limiting
**Implementation:** Request throttling using Redis to limit API calls per IP address/user
**Purpose:** Prevents brute force attacks, DDoS attempts, and API abuse by limiting the number of requests in a given time period.

### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization
**Implementation:** Comprehensive validation using Django validators and serializers
**Purpose:** Protects against SQL injection, XSS attacks, and other injection vulnerabilities by ensuring only properly formatted data is processed.

### 5. HTTPS Encryption
**Implementation:** SSL/TLS encryption for all API communications
**Purpose:** Encrypts data in transit to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 6. CORS Configuration
**Implementation:** Proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing settings for frontend-backend communication
**Purpose:** Controls which domains can access the API, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests.

### 7. Payment Security
**Implementation:** PCI DSS compliance with tokenized payments and no sensitive data storage
**Purpose:** Ensures financial transactions are processed securely without exposing credit card information.

## Why Security is Crucial

### User Data Protection
Security measures prevent unauthorized access to personal information, protecting users' privacy and maintaining compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

### Financial Security
Secure payment processing is essential to prevent financial fraud, protect credit card information, and maintain trust in the platform's monetary transactions.

### Platform Integrity
Robust security prevents malicious activities that could compromise the platform's functionality, such as fake listings, booking manipulation, or review fraud.

### Business Reputation
Strong security practices build user trust and protect the company's reputation by demonstrating commitment to safeguarding user data and transactions.

### Legal Compliance
Proper security implementation ensures compliance with various regulations and prevents potential legal issues and fines related to data breaches.

### System Availability
Security measures like rate limiting and DDoS protection ensure the platform remains available and responsive to legitimate users.

# CI/CD Pipeline

## What is CI/CD?

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a modern software development practice that automates the process of integrating code changes, testing them, and deploying them to production environments. CI focuses on automatically building and testing code changes, while CD automates the deployment of validated code to various environments.
